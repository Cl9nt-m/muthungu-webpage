        we must take to like a spider in its web </br>
        to whatever you aspire, ego is the enemy,</br>
        no adornment so becomes you as modesty,
justice, and self-control; for these are the virtues by which, as all men are agreed,
the character of the young is held in restraint.</br>
        Be affable in your relations with those who approach you,
and never haughty; for the pride of the arrogant even slaves can hardly endure</br>
        Be slow in deliberation, but be prompt to carry out your resolves</br>
        the greatest thing in the smallest compass is a sound mind in a human body.</br>
        <pre>This above all: to thine own self be true,
And it must follow, as the night the day,
Thou canst not then be false to any man.
Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!</pre>
        Detachment is a sort of natural ego antidote.</br>
        Facts are better than dreams</br>
        Mere gossip anticipates real talk, and to express what is still in thought weakens action by forestalling it. Silence
        is the respite of the confident and the strong.</br>
        Never give reasons for you what think or do until you must. Maybe, after a while, a better reason will pop into your head.</br>
        <h2>To be or to do? Which way will you go?</h2>
        “A man is worked upon by what he works on,” Frederick Douglass once said.</br>
        to become great, he said, needs to have someone better that they can learn from, someone lesser who they can teach, and someone equal that they can challenge themselves against.</br>
        “It is impossible to learn that which one thinks one already knows,” Epictetus
says.</br>
        “When student is ready, the teacher appears.”</br>
