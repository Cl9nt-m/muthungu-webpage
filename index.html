                <p><span class="heading">Dedan Kimathi Waciuri</span>. A prominent figure in the struggle for Kenya's Independence from the British Colonial Rule.<br>
                Born on October 31, 1920, in Tetu, Nyeri District.
                He attended primary school and later enrolled at Alliance High School in Kikuyu. After completing his education, He worked as a clerk at the Nairobi 
                City Counsil.<br> 
                He joined the Kenya African Union (KAU), an organistion that advocated for African rights and Independence.
                When KAU was banned by the colonial government, he became one of the leaders of the Mau Mau Movement, which aimed to end British rule ans secure land and freedom for 
                Kenyans. <br>
                He and the Mau Mau fighters employed various guerrilla tactics to disrupt British control and maintain pressure on the colonial authorities. They operated from hidden 
                forest bases, carried out ambushes, sabotaged infrastructure, and used hit-and-run tactics to evade capture. The goal was to undermine British rule ans inspire other 
                Africans to join the struggle for Independence.<br>
                </p>
                <p>In October 1956, He was captured by British security forces after being wounded in a gun battle. He was taken to "Trial", which was highly publicized and widely 
                   followed. Despite the efforts of his defense team and international appeals for clemency, He was found guilty of multiple charges.<br>
                   In February 18, 1957, <span class="heading">Dedan Kimathi Waciuri</span> was executed by hanging in Kamiti Maximum Security Prison in Nairobi. His execution sparked
                   controversy and protests both within Kenya and internationally. He was a martyr and a symbol os resistance against colonial oppression.<br>
                   His legacy continues to be celebrated in Kenya. In 2003, he was posthumosly awarded the Order of the Elder of the Burning Spear, one of Kenya's highest honors, by 
                   The late President Mwai Kibaki. His grave in Nairobi has become a site of rememberance and pilgrimage.
